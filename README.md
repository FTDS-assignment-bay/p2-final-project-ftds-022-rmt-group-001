## PropertyWorth

# Introduction
As is widely recognized, a home is a highly desired asset for individuals. Beyond being a place of residence, it can also function as a lucrative investment, given its historical tendency to increase in value over time. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the absence of a dedicated website or app for accurately estimating the selling price of a house. This is why we have created the "PropertyWorth" application to aid individuals, developers, and house appraisers in ascertaining the appropriate selling price for their properties in the DKI Jakarta region.

# Dependencies
- Web Scraper (Mozilla extension for web-scraping)
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (Plot)
- Seaborn (Plot)
- Plotly (Interactive Plot)
- Numpy
- Geopandas (Generate Latitude & Longitude)
- Folium (Generate Geospatial Map)

# ETL (Extract, Transform dan Load)

Perform extraction on the website lamudi.com using the Web Scraper extension in the Mozilla Firefox browser, and then cleaning the file as needed.

# EDA 

Before modeling the data, it's a good idea to get to know or explore the data we have. The results of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) are as follows:

## Conclusion

In this project, we have succeeded in creating an application that is able to predict the selling price of houses in the DKI Jakarta area. However, we realize that there are still many improvements that can be made to make this application more accurate.

Here's the link to try the app:
